# Factory Simulator

## How to Use

Dependencies:
- NumPy
- SciPy

Works with pip's default versions as of 12/05/2025.

Clone this git repo: `git clone https://github.com/Anticubex/advpyfinal`.

Navigate into the directory and simply run the main python script and the CLI will boot up: `python main.py [name of json file]`

The CLI allows you to create and edit a factory. When you run the script, it will decide on a `.json` file to save your model to.
By default, this file is `factory.json`, but you can specify it as a command line argument.
